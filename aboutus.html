        <h1>How We Started</h1>
        <p>
            Jason's Chassis Shop started out as a small side gig in Jason's home garage. After he
            finished welding school, he started JCS as a grassroots fab shop with the intent to just do
            some light fab work. That all changed when a friend asked him to help him with a weld-in
            8.50 cage for his Mustang. After finishing that cage he knew that was what he wanted to do.
            JCS is now the home of 15 fabricators and is based in a 100,000 square foot shop in
            North Carolina. We do more than just chassis work, you can order your own custom rear end
            with ladder bar or 4 link brackets <a href="order.html">here!</a>

        <p>
            Jason started out with nothing but a passion and this little Harbor Freight welder.
            It's a testament to where hard work can get you!
